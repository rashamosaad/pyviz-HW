This is an interactive dashboard to analyze the Real Estate market in SF from 2010 to 2016. I divided the dashboard to 4 different tabs:
1) Welcome tab where I gave a brief explantion about the nature and the purpose of the dashboard. Also a map was included to give the investor a quick idead about the neigbeorhoods and the different sale price /sq foot and gross rent for each neighborhood.
2) Yearly Market Analysis tab where I looked at the market three ways:
        a) Average sale price per square foot per neighborhood per year (from 2010 to 2016).
        b) Average sale price per square foot per neighborhood per year (from 2010 to 2016) - Interactive.
        c) Average gross rent per neighborhood per year.
3) Neighborhood Market Analysis tab where I got the average sale price per square foot per neighborhood per year and used this analysis to find the top ten most expensive neighborhoods in SF.
4) Parallel Plots tab that inluded
        a) Parallel Coordinates plot
        b) Parallel Categories plot 
   to provide investors insight into the sale price per square foot and the the different neighborhoods. 
   
 Finally, I added the tabs into a panel to create a dashboard for investors to get the data they need for making decisions through the interactive plots and dashboard.
